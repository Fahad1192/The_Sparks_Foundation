#### Task 1: Prediction of Student's scores using Supervised ML :man_student:

- I have predicted the percentage of marks scored by the students based on the number of study hours.
- Used some EDA techniques in python and implemented Linear Regressiona with both sklearn and statsmodel.

#### Task 2: Prediction using Unsupervised ML :sunflower: 

- Used unsupervised KMeans clustering on Iris dataset

#### Task 3: EDA on Sample superstore dataset :department_store:

- Used some EDA techniques and found out some valuable insights from the SampleSuperstore dataset.

#### Task 4: Analyzing Global Terrorism Dataset 

- Analyzed and visualized global terrorism dataset to find out some valuable insights like active years, attack types, popular targets, most affected countries, organization involved in most attacks, motives behind attack etc.
